## Key Project Phases:

### Cleaning and Analyzing using Power Query:

Connected to HR data in Excel and employed Power Query to meticulously clean and transform the data.
Developed a template in Power Query for consistent transformations across multiple sheets.
Applied essential cleaning steps, including duplicate removal, column renaming, and data type adjustments.
Implemented parameterization for data selection based on specific conditions.
Encapsulated all transformations into a reusable function for future data sets.
Loaded and applied the refined data into Power BI for further analysis.

### Exploring and Manipulating Data Using DAX Query:

Utilized DAX Query to effectively manipulate and analyze data, providing insights for visualization and identifying areas for HR improvement.
Created measures and columns using DAX functions such as COUNT and SUM to enhance dashboard KPIs in Power BI.

### Power BI Dashboard Visualization:

Designed an intuitive dashboard layout for comprehensive visualization.
Developed a measure table employing DAX functions to aggregate and display data effectively.
Utilized various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, column charts, cards, matrix charts, and donut charts.
Implemented informative KPIs and utilized a Month column as a slicer for dynamic data exploration.
Culminated in the creation of an insightful "HR Analytics Dashboard."

## Conclusion:

The project culminated in a thorough analysis of employee data, revealing trends and insights through Power Query and DAX in Power BI. The interactive dashboard effectively tracked employee turnover and identified reasons for attrition. Notably, the analysis unveiled that sales personnel were departing due to salary concerns and stagnant hike rates. 

The visualizations and actionable insights provided to the HR team serve as strategic guidance to address these issues and enhance employee retention practices.
